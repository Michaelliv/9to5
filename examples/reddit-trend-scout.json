Ignore memes, images (i.redd.it), megathreads, and pure industry gossip.\n\nStep 3: Assess which posts overlap with these topics: Claude Code, agent architecture, tool design, infrastructure, context engineering, CLI tooling, semantic layers, software engineering. Pick the single best candidate for a blog post.\n\nStep 4: If you find a strong candidate:\n- Read .claude/skills/writing-guidelines/SKILL.md for style rules\n- Read 2-3 recent posts from src/content/blog/ to match the voice\n- Search existing posts for internal backlink candidates\n- Draft a 300-600 word post in src/content/blog/<slug>.md\n- Create branch post/<slug>, commit, push, open a PR with summary\n\nStep 5: If nothing is worth drafting, report what you found and why you skipped.",
