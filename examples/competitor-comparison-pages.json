Be factual, cite specific features.>\n\n## Where <Competitor> Wins\n\n<1-2 bullet points on what the competitor does better, if anything. Be honest — credibility matters.>\n\n## Bottom Line\n\n<2-3 sentences on who should choose which tool and why. Position 9to5 as the better choice for developers who want control, visibility, and cost management over their scheduled AI tasks.>\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Create an index page\nWrite docs/comparisons/index.md listing all comparison pages with a one-line summary of each.\n\n## Step 5: Commit and push\n  git checkout -b docs/competitor-comparisons\n  git add docs/comparisons/\n  git commit -m \"docs: update competitor comparison pages [automated]\"\n  git push -u origin docs/competitor-comparisons\n\nIf the branch already exists, just commit and push the updates.\n\n## Step 6: Report\nOutput a summary of what you found and updated. If a new competitor appeared, highlight it.",
